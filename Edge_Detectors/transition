For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to positive edge detection). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);
    reg [7:0] in_d;
    always @(posedge clk)
        begin
            in_d<=in;
            pedge<=(~in_d) & in;
            
        end
    

endmodule
