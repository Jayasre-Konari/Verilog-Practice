You're familiar with flip-flops that are triggered on the positive edge of the clock, or negative edge of the clock. 
A dual-edge triggered flip-flop is triggered on both edges of the clock. 
However, FPGAs don't have dual-edge triggered flip-flops, and always @(posedge clk or negedge clk) is not accepted as a legal sensitivity list.

//code
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output q
);
    reg q_pos,q_neg;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
        begin
       q_pos<=d;
        end
    always @(negedge clk)
        begin
        q_neg<=d;
        end
    assign q=clk?q_pos:q_neg;
        
endmodule
