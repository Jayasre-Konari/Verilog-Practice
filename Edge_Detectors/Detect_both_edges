For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect any edge). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.

//code
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] anyedge
);
    reg [7:0] in_d;
    always @(posedge clk)
        begin
            in_d<=in;
            anyedge<= (in_d^in) ;
        end
endmodule
