Build a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive, with a period of 10. The reset input is synchronous, and should reset the counter to 0
//code
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,       
    output reg [3:0] q);
    always @(posedge clk)
        if(reset)
            q<=0;
       
        else if(q==9)
            q<=0;
        else
            q<=q+1;
           
endmodule
